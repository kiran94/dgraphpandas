Samples can be found [here](https://github.com/kiran94/dgraphpandas/tree/main/samples). They follow a convention where the download script can be found within the `input` directory and the config, generate_upsert, publish scripts can be found root of each respective sample.

There are also [Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/kiran94/dgraphpandas/tree/main/samples/notebooks) which should show step by step examples.
